# Fee Fi Fo Fum.üìä
Welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Jonathan Daniel. I'm an aspiring Data Scientist with a deep interest in uncovering insights, solving real-world problems, and using data to help make better decisions. I'm transitioning into tech, building a strong foundation in Data Analytics, Python, and Machine Learning through learning and hands-on projects.

## üî¨ What I‚Äôm working on:
- Data exploration and visualisation using Power BI
- Writing efficient queries and transformations with SQL
- Building predictive models and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python
- Documenting and sharing end-to-end workflows for learning and collaboration
