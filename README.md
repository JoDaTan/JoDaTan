# Fee Fi Fo Fum.📊
Welcome to my GitHub!

![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=JoDaTan&color=green)

I work with data to extract, clean, and analyse information that supports better business and operational decisions. 
My projects focus on SQL-based analysis, Python data exploration, Machine Learning, ETL workflows, and dashboard-driven insights using Power BI and Streamlit.

This GitHub contains hands-on projects covering exploratory data analysis, data transformation, reporting, and applied modelling, with an emphasis on data quality, clarity, and real-world use cases.

## 🔬 What I’m working on:
- Data exploration and visualisation using Power BI
- Writing efficient queries and transformations with SQL
- Building predictive models and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python
- Documenting and sharing end-to-end workflows for learning and collaboration
