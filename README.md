I solve business problems with data because I've seen what happens when you don't.

5+ years managing operations data at Nigerian Breweries taught me something most analysts never learn: bad data doesn't just create wrong reports. It causes missed deliveries, revenue loss, angry customers, and operational chaos.

Now I build analytics solutions that prevent those problems.

Every project here shows I deliver clean data, clear insights, and measurable results.

## What I Do
I turn operational data into business decisions.
- Write SQL queries that extract insights from enterprise systems
- Build Power BI dashboards that drive action
- Design ETL pipelines that transform chaos into clean datasets
- Deploy ML models that predict outcomes with measurable accuracy

## 📚 Featured Projects
### 🏥 [Customer Churn Analysis](https://github.com/JoDaTan/customer-churn-analysis)
**Python | Exploratory Data Analysis | Customer Analytics**

**The Problem:** Maven Music is experiencing a high customer churn rate (43%), with a significant number of users cancelling their subscriptions shortly after joining.

**What I Built:** A business-focused customer churn analysis for Maven Music aimed at identifying customer churn drivers and recommendations to improve customer retention.

**Key Finding:** Day 4 is the Magic retention threshold. Customers with 4+ active days have 0% churn.

### 🎵 [Spotify User Analysis](https://github.com/JoDaTan/Spotify-streaming-history)

**SQL | PostgreSQL | ETL | Star Schema**

**The Problem:** Extract user listening insights from raw JSON streaming data.

**What I Built:** Complete ETL pipeline transforming messy data into a clean Star Schema database. Advanced SQL queries (joins, CTEs, window functions) to uncover listening patterns.

**The Result:** Data quality improved from 75% ➡️ 98%. Identified top artists, genres, peak listening times, and skip rate trends.

### 🚀 [Return to Space Challenge](https://github.com/JoDaTan/space-mission)
**Power BI | DAX | Data Modeling | Interactive Dashboards**

**The Problem:** 5,000+ space missions spanning 65 years needed a clear visualisation to tell humanity's space exploration story.

**What I Built:** Cleaned mission data, designed a Star Schema model, and created an interactive Power BI dashboard with DAX measures tracking success rates and reliability trends across countries and organisations.

**The Result:** Identified most reliable launch providers through performance metrics. Visualised the evolution of the space race in executive-friendly dashboards.

### 🔥 [Calorie Expenditure Prediction](https://github.com/JoDaTan/calorie-expenditure-prediction)
**Python | Machine Learning | Streamlit | Production Deployment**

**The Problem:** Fitness professionals needed accurate, real-time calorie burn estimates for different exercise sessions.

**What I Built:** End-to-end regression model with preprocessing pipeline, hyperparameter tuning, and SHAP interpretability. Deployed as a Streamlit web application.

**The Result:** Achieved R² 0.997 accuracy. The model identified exercise duration and heart rate as primary predictors. Delivered production-ready tool accessible to non-technical users.
